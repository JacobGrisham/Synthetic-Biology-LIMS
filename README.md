## ‚öñÔ∏è Methodology
-   Single Page Application for a better user experience.
-   Separated front-end and back-end to avoid a monolithic architecture and to lay the foundation of a microservices architecture.
-   Microservices architecture for decoupled business logic and more flexibility for adaptations in the future.
-   React for front-end for the component-based approach to writing code, one-way data flow, and virtual document-object-model (DOM). Chose React over Angular and Vue since I have the most experience with React.
-   Redux for managing state in React since this is a large application and managing React states would become unweidly in the long run.
-   React and Redux both written in Typescript to leverage static typing for a more secure and well-tested application.
-   Styled Components for styling for leveraging the power and benefits of CSS-in-JS.
-   Django RESTful API for back-end. Django-rest-framework to simplify Create, Read, Update, and Delete routes. I've built a Django REST API without the help of a framework and there are no benefits to building routes at a lower level.
-   Celery for asynchronous operations within Python since Django asynchronous support is still just for views (as of v3.1).
-   SQL Database for leveraging the benefits of relational databases
-   PostgreSQL as the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) since it has more features integrations in Django
-   Docker containerization of the application while in development mode because there are four different services and docker-compose provides automation for starting and ending the services.
-   circleci for continuous integration and continuous delivery since I have the most experience with circleci. Considered using Jenkins, but my focus as a Web Developer is not DevOps.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
-   Manage user groups
-   Manage chemical/biological inventory
-   Manage protocols
-   Manage projects (made up of protocols)
-   Manage jobs (completing the protocol in a project)
-   Manage products (output from a job)
