## ‚öñÔ∏è Methodology
-   Single Page Application for a better user experience.
-   Separated front-end and back-end to avoid a monolithic architecture and to lay the foundation of a microservices architecture.
-   Microservices architecture for decoupled business logic and more flexibility for adaptations in the future.
-   React for front-end for the component-based approach to writing code, one-way data flow, and virtual document-object-model (DOM). Chose React over Angular and Vue since I have the most experience with React.
-   Redux for managing state in React since this is a large application and managing React states would become unweidly in the long run.
-   React and Redux both written in Typescript to leverage static typing for a more secure and well-tested application.
-   Styled Components for styling for leveraging the power and benefits of CSS-in-JS.
-   Django RESTful API for back-end. Django-rest-framework to simplify Create, Read, Update, and Delete routes. I've built a Django REST API without the help of a framework and there are no benefits to building routes at a lower level.
-   Celery for asynchronous operations within Python since Django asynchronous support is still just for views (as of v3.1).
-   SQL Database for leveraging the benefits of relational databases
-   PostgreSQL as the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) since it has more features integrations in Django
-   Docker containerization of the application while in development mode because there are four different services and docker-compose provides automation for starting and ending the services.
-   circleci for continuous integration and continuous delivery since I have the most experience with circleci. Considered using Jenkins, but my focus as a Web Developer is not DevOps.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
-   Manage user groups
-   Manage chemical/biological inventory
-   Manage protocols
-   Manage projects (made up of protocols)
-   Manage jobs (completing the protocol in a project)
-   Manage products (output from a job)

## üöÄ Getting Started
### To run this project on your system:
<ol>
  <li>Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running on your computer</li>
  <li>Make sure you have [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed and running on your computer. If you installed PostgreSQL with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), then you can start PostgreSQL with `brew services start postgresql`</li>
  <li>Make sure you have [Redis](https://redis.io/download) installed and running on your computer</li>
  <li>In your terminal, navigate to the root of this repository and run `docker-compose up` (you will have to run `docker-compose up --build` for the first setup phase)</li>
</ol>


**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** if you are getting conflict errors, you should run `docker stop <container name>` that is already running in the background.  
**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** if you are getting other errors, you should run `docker-compose down` to bring everything down, and start over.  

### To contribute to this project on your system:
-   Ensure that `git lfs` is installed on your system. Download the extension here [git-lfs.github.com](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
-   To make git commits, navigate to the root directory, add files to git staging, and then run `npm run commit` to ensure your commit follows the [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev) guidelines.

## üìê Tests
-   Interactive code coverage diagram on [codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/JacobGrisham/Synthetic-Biology-LIMS). The code coverage takes into account both the Django unit tests and the React unit/integration tests.
-   [Django unit](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/JacobGrisham/Synthetic-Biology-LIMS/50/workflows/d5bd12a2-0792-49e8-b318-54b0cb35f843/jobs/117/tests) and the [React unit/integration](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/JacobGrisham/Synthetic-Biology-LIMS/50/workflows/d5bd12a2-0792-49e8-b318-54b0cb35f843/jobs/116/tests) junit.xml test reports and code coverage artifacts automatically uploaded to circleci.
